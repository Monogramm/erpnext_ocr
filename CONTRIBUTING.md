Contributing
============

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!

You can report bugs or request new features by creating an [issue](https://github.com/Monogramm/erpnext_ocr/issues), or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Monogramm/erpnext_ocr/pulls) with your contribution.

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews and discussions before maintainers accept and merge your work.

You MUST follow the [The Best of the Best Practices (BOBP) Guide for Python](https://gist.github.com/sloria/7001839). If you don't know about any of them, you should really read the recommendations.

You SHOULD write tests.

You SHOULD write documentation.

Please, write [commit messages that make sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) before submitting your Pull Request.

If possible, use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) in your commit message to ease code reviews.

One may ask you to [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) too. This is used to "clean" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).

Also, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it. If your Pull Request is related to one or several issues, you SHOULD reference them in your PR description. See GitHub documentation on [how to close issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords).

Thank you!
